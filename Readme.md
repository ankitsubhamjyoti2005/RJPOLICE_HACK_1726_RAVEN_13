# Connecting Communities for Safer Streets

## Problem Statement

Inadequacies in online crime reporting systems, lacking anonymous submissions, live video uploads, and real-time location sharing that severely hinder law enforcement, causing delays and risking crucial evidence loss during investigations.

## Solution
Our project leverages cutting-edge technology and user-friendly features to empower communities and law enforcement agencies. We are developing a system for anonymous submissions, a wanted criminal detection system, live location sharing, real-time video uploads, geofencing, and a live interaction system.

Our system ensures swift and efficient communication between users and authorities and efficiently identifies and tracks wanted criminals. Instantly analyzing uploaded images or videos, this advanced technology empowers law enforcement, offering a potent tool for effective incident response and the apprehension of individuals of interest by implementing robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard user data.

## Features

1. **Anonymous Reporting:** Enable users to submit crime reports anonymously, ensuring the protection of their privacy and encouraging a higher level of community participation in providing information.

2. **Live Location Sharing:** Empower users to share their real-time location with law enforcement and patrol vehicles, enabling a swift response to incidents and enhancing overall public safety.

3. **Geofencing for Proximity Alerts:** Utilize geofencing technology to notify nearby police stations and patrol vehicles of incidents, optimizing coordination and response speed for law enforcement.

4. **Real-time Video Submission:** Facilitate real-time video uploads, allowing users to promptly submit critical evidence, thereby streamlining and expediting the investigative process.

5. **Live Interaction System:** Integrate a live interaction system featuring video calls and chat functionalities for emergency situations, promoting effective real-time communication between users and authorities.
